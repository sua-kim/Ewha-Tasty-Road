# Restaurant Website Description

### - Topic:
 A website that provides information on restaurants around Ewha Womans University and shares reviews

### - Overview:

 There are various restaurants around our school, but students have difficulty selecting menus because they go to restaurants they always go to or have a wide range of options. Some students often create and share a map of restaurants, but there are disadvantages that are difficult to update every time a restaurant is opened or closed. In addition, there are many reviews recommending restaurants around the school within the community site, but they are sporadically distributed, making it difficult to search. Therefore, we try to make it easier to get the information we want by creating a website that provides information about restaurants around the school and provides a simple review of it.

### - Expected Outcomes: 

  ① By enabling users to search for restaurants that meet various conditions, users can reduce their concerns about menu selection.

  ② By integrating restaurant reviews that exist sporadically in various communities in the school into one website, we will be able to effectively build a database of restaurants around Ewha Womans University.

  ③ By creating a form for users to submit reviews, users can find recent reviews about restaurants and overall score by using average function.
